# travel_stories

Code related to my trips

## Instructions

You will need to have Anaconda installed (download it from the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#Downloads">official website</a>, and choose your operating system's installer). 

Once it is installed in your system, open an `Anaconda Prompt` and create the environment with

```conda env create -f environment.yml```

It will take some time for Conda to download and install all packages. When it finishes, activate the environment via:

```conda activate -n travel_stories```

Then open a Jupyter notebook session:

```jupyter notebook```

And a web browser tab will allow you to select the notebook you want to play with.

Open that notebook and enjoy!
